Node 24
You step left and the orc turns to face you. At the same time Grog is running towards the orc who has its back turned at him. You deflect a few of the orc's blows. Eventually Grog reaches you and lodges his hatches as deep into the orc's back as he can. The orc flails around a few moments and dies. You have killed the orc. You have won. Game Over.
